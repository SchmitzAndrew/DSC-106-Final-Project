    Have you ever wanted to be able to predict things whether it is the type of species of an animal, roll of a die,  etc. 
    A major drawback when it comes to estimating things in nature is that itâ€™s rare that we have the true distribution of where the data came from.
    One approach that data scientists use is they assume the data comes from some parametric density given the data is continuous. 
  </p>

  <p>
    To start Data Scientists first make an assumption that being that the true, underlying density has a certain form. 
    A common assumption used is that the true distribution is Gaussian or also known as normal distribution. 
    With this assumption there are two parameters that determine the shape of the distribution being mean and standard deviation. 
    The mean controls the center and the standard deviation controls the width of the distribution. 
    But because we do not know the true density we have to make assumptions on the parameters.
